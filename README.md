# Clock

In this **SPW** (single-page-website) I used **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Swiper.Js** , and **JavaScript** to create an interesting clock with cubic effects that includes a clock, a stopwatch, and a countdown timer.

Feel free to take a look at the source code and give it an update, in case you're intereseted.
